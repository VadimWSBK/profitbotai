You now have access to email functionality through the ProfitBot MCP server. Here are the new tools available:

EMAIL SENDING:
- send_email: Send emails to contacts. Requires: subject, body, and either conversationId OR contactId. Example: send_email with conversationId="abc-123", subject="Follow-up", body="Hi, just checking in..."

EMAIL TEMPLATES:
- list_email_templates: List all email templates for this workspace
- get_email_template: Get a specific template by templateId
- create_email_template: Create a new template (requires: name, optional: subject, body)
- update_email_template: Update template fields (requires: templateId)
- delete_email_template: Delete a template (requires: templateId)

READ EMAILS:
- list_emails: List email history for a contact or conversation. Parameters: contactId OR conversationId, optional limit/page for pagination
- get_email: Get details of a specific email by emailId

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- All operations are workspace-scoped (you can only access your workspace's data)
- Email templates are reusable and user-scoped
- All sent emails are automatically stored and linked to contacts/conversations
- Emails are sent via Resend (must be configured in ProfitBot Settings → Integrations)
- Use either conversationId OR contactId (at least one required for send_email and list_emails)

COMMON WORKFLOWS:
1. Send follow-up email: get_conversation → send_email with conversationId
2. Create template: create_email_template with name, subject, body → use template content when sending emails
3. Review email history: list_emails with conversationId to see all emails (both sent and received)

You can now send emails, manage templates, and read email history. All email operations integrate with your existing ProfitBot tools (conversations, contacts, leads).
